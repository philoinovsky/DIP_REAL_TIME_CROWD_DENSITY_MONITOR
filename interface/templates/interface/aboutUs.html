            <h4>Who are we?</h4>
                <p>We’re a group of students wanting to provide the best experience for staffs and students in NTU. Due to COVID-19 there is a need to prevent overcrowding which aligns to the Singapore Government’s advocacy on social distancing. Thus we have come up with a system to inform users of the current time capacity of locations conveniently through a website. This makes it more sustainable in complying with social distancing.
                </p><br>
            <h4>What is this project about?</h4>
                <p>This project aims to introduce a Real Time Crowd Density Monitor using a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is a small digital device capable of storing and processing images (with the aid of a high shuttle speed camera) then converting them into data using programming language instantaneously. This project not only eliminates the need for individuals to physically check in, it also provides up-to-the-minute information on the human crowd size.
